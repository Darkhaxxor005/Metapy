OSripper is a fully undetectable Backdoor generator and Crypter which specialises in OSX M1 malware. Even though it specialises in OSX malware it also works well for generating windows malware. It now not only generates normal unix executables but also .apps.

## Description

OSripper not only generates backdoors but also obfuscates and compiles them. This also includes apple M1 backdoors. Take a closer look at the Roadmap to see how close we are to achieving our goal of total evasion but the results so far are extremely good. In the future i will definetly develop some more specialised and sophisticated Backdoors.

Here are example backdoors which were generated with OSRipper

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

You  need python. If you do not wish to download python you can download a compiled release.
